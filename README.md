## Portfolio Website - Portfolio 2

This repository contains my personal portfolio website, created as part of **Portfolio 2** in the Noroff Front-End Development program (online).

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate professional documentation, clear project presentation, and a clear overview of selected coursework completed during my studies.

## Description

The portfolio website presents three projects completed during my studies at Noroff:

- **Project Exam 2** - Accommodation booking site built with React

- **Javascript Frameworks CA** - eCommerce store built with React.

Each project is presented with:

- A screenshot
